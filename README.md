## GMOD Mania
An osu!mania clone in GMOD. 

To install: Put the mania.lua in your garrysmod/lua/autorun folder. Thats it!

This will recognize any osu!mania 4k song. To add one, create a pull request to the repo with:
```lua
--//(songname).txt, this can be any 4k mania difficulty. Whole thing works too!
--//(songname).ogg, song of the map
```
